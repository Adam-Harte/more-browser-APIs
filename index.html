		<h3>Data Attributes</h3>
		<p>
			Data attributes are attributes you can add to DOM elements to store extra
			data such as strings, numbers or booleans. You define data atrributes in
			HTML elements with the 'data-' attribute syntax followed by the name you
			want to give the attrbiute. Data atrributes can be get or set in
			JavaScript with the dataset property on HTMl elements followed by the data
			atrribute name wthout the 'data-'.
		</p>
		<div class="data" data-extraInfo="info">Extra data</div>
		<h3>Element Box Dimensions</h3>
		<p>
			We can tet an elements box dimensions, position and coordinates in
			JavaScript by using the getBoundingClientRect method. When we call this
			method on an element we get that elements size(width, height), position
			(top, left, bottom, right) and coordiantes (x, y). The coordinates system
			is based on the way browsers render pages so from top to bottom in the y
			and left to right in the x therefore that top left position is 0,0. The
			right and bottom positons are a combination of the elemnts width, height
			and x and y values e.g. width + x for right and height + y for bottom.
		</p>
		<div id="box" class="blue-box"></div>
		<h3>Element Sizes and Positions</h3>
		<p>
			We can get specific information about an element such as size and position
			information with offset and client properties. Using offsetTop and
			offsetLeft properties give us the elements top and left positions based on
			the browser coordinates. We can use clientTop and clientLeft to get the
			top and left positions of the content inside the elements e.g. content
			after borders. There is the offsetWidth and offsetHeight properties to get
			the whole element size including borders etc. There is also clientWidth
			and clientHeight to get the elements size excluding borders etc. We can
			also check the actual broswer windows size using window.innerWidth and
			window.innerHeight. To get the real available browser window size we can
			use document.documentElement clientHeight or clientWidth properties.
			Finally when elements are scrollabel we can check the scroll information
			with scrollHeight and scrollTop. The scrollHeight property gives us the
			total size of the element including the hidden height thats scrollable,
			scrollTop gives us the number by how much the element has been scrolled 0
			being no scroll.
		</p>
		<h3>Scrolling</h3>
		<p>
			We can control element scrolling in JavaScript with the scrollTo, scrollBy
			and scrollIntoView methods. The scrollTo method scrolls an element to the
			specified x and y values passed whereas scrollBy relatively adds scroll
			values x and y to the exisiting scroll. The scrollIntoView method scrolls
			the parent container of that element so that it is in view. All these
			mthods optionally take in an options object argument where you can define
			behaviour for example to be smooth so that the scroll position update
			animates.
		</p>
		<h3>Template Tags</h3>
		<p>
			The template html tag allows us to define a reusable chunk/template of
			html markup. This is great to make resuable sections of html that we can
			grab and import into nodes in JavaScript. We can use these template tags
			in JavaScript by grabbing them with a DOM query and then via the content
			property. To use the content in areas of html we can use the document
			importNode method to pass the template tag content and get back the
			returned nodes which we can then append or do whatever kind of addition we
			want into to our html structure.
